        <div class=content><br>
  Despite living in a city, up until recently I only had the possibility to get broadband over cable (Virgin Media) or DSL. This meant I was I was paying €76 per month for a TV and Broadband package from Virgin Media. At one point in the past it was up to €96 a month.<br>
  <br>
  As I work from home a good internet connection was important, as well as good latency. DSL wasn't particularly fast or cheap and the phone line would need to be moved to make it useable, so I didn't go with that option.<br>
 <br>
		To get the costs down I <a href='https://smwk.github.io/freesat.html'>removed the TV package</a> and instead used a mix of satellite (Freesat) and arial (Saorview), which brought the monthly cost down to €64 a month for broadband only.<br>
    <br>
    After a chance discussion with a colleague I heard that Three Mobile had a 5G broadband package going for €39 a month. I was a little sceptical on wireless broadband but it turned out I wasn't that far from the nearest 5G mast.<br>
         <br>
		I went for an 'expert' installation package so it would be mounted externally where I live. However as a test I plugged in the modem inside and found the speeds were as good as before, with download speeds of about 94Mbps, the same as with my previous broadband.<br>
		<br>
		While 94Mbps is fine for me it was still a bit strange the speed came in exatly the same as before, I eventually tracked this down to the cable used between the modem and my wireless router. I had used an old cable based purely on the colour so it could be easily distinguished, but it was still a surprise to find a Cat5 cable.<br>
		<br>
		When the installer arrived a few days later he checked for the local base station, I had assumed the closest was to the East but it turned out there was a new mast to the West only 140 meters away, though not quite line of sight. Rather than install the modem externally we instead moved it to a different part of the room.<br>

          <br>

         <br>
          The modem itself looks ok, has a much needed feature of being able to turn off the activity lights and is powered by POE. Possibly I could have just gone with the indoor self install version, but I didn't really know what type of connection I was going to get.<br>

		<br>
          Cost wise it makes a big difference, you get 3 months free and the price goes up by 3% every year, much less than Virgin Media do with their price increases. The saving for this year will be about €400 and about €300 in the following years.<br>
